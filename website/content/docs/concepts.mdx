description: How hun thinks about your code.

To get the most out of **hun**, it helps to understand its mental model.
It's simple, but it might be different from what you are used to.

## The "Project" Unit

Most tools operate on **files** (editors), **containers** (Docker), or **processes** (supervisord).
**hun** operates on **Project**.

A Project is a collection of services that need to run together to do useful work.
-   A backend API (Python)
-   A frontend SPA (React)
-   A database (Postgres)
-   A cache (Redis)

In **hun**, you don't start the "backend". You start the **Project**. The backend is just a detail.

## The Daemon

When you run `hun` commands, you aren't actually running the logic in your current shell.
You are sending instructions to the **Hun Daemon**.

The Daemon is a background process that acts as the "sysadmin" for your local machine.
It:
-   **Owns the child processes.** If you close your terminal window, your server doesn't die.
-   **Captures output.** It acts as a middleman for stdout/stderr, saving logs to a ring buffer and disk.
-   **Manages ports.** It ensures projects don't fight over port 3000.

This architecture is why you can run `hun switch` in one terminal, close it, open a simplified VS Code terminal, run `hun status`, and see everything is still fine.

## Focus Mode vs. Multitask Mode

**hun** acknowledges two different ways of working.

### Focus Mode (Default)
*"I am doing one thing right now."*

When you `hun switch project-a`:
1.  `project-b` (if running) is stopped.
2.  Ports are freed.
3.  `project-a` starts.
4.  Services bind to their default ports (e.g., `3000`).

This is how most of us want to work 90% of the time. It keeps your machine cool and your CPU happy.

### Multitask Mode
*"I need to reference Project A while working on Project B."*

Sometimes you need two things running at once. Maybe `Project B` consumes an API from `Project A`.

```bash
hun run project-b
```

In this mode:
1.  `project-a` stays running.
2.  `project-b` starts *alongside* it.
3.  **Port Offsets**: If both try to bind port 3000, **hun** will automatically shift `project-b` to 3001 (or another offset) to prevent collisions.

This keeps you flexible without the manual "port tetris".
