## Common Issues

### "Service Starting..." forever
Check the `ready` configuration in `.hun.yml`.
If you set `ready: "Server started"`, **hun** greps the logs for that exact string.
If your server actually prints `Server is running`, **hun** will never switch from `STARTING` to `RUNNING`.

**Fix:** Update `.hun.yml` or remove the `ready` check.

### "Address already in use"
This usually happens if:
1.  You have a stray process running outside of **hun**.
2.  Two services in the same project try to use the same port.
3.  You are in Multitask mode and the port offset logic failed (rare).

**Fix**:
1.  `hun stop --all`
2.  `lsof -i :3000` (check for stray processes)
3.  `kill -9 <PID>`

### Daemon won't start
Check `~/.hun/logs/daemon.log`.
Ensure permissions on `~/.hun/daemon.sock` are correct (your user should own it).

## Reporting Bugs

Please open an issue on GitHub with:
1.  Your OS (macOS/Linux)
2.  `hun --version`
3.  Relevant logs from `~/.hun/logs/`

We appreciate it!
