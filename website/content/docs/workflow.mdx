description: A day in the life with hun.

Here is how **hun** fits into a typical developer's day.

## 09:00 AM - Start the day

You open your terminal. You don't even need to be in the directory.

```bash
hun
```

The TUI opens. You press `p` and select `acme-core`.
You are instantly switched to it. You see the database come up (Green), then the API (Green), then the Frontend (Green).
You verify everything looks good, maybe check a log or two.
You press `q` to dismiss the TUI. Everything runs in the background.
You open `localhost:3000` and start coding.

## 11:30 AM - The "Quick favor"

A coworker asks you to look at a bug in the legacy reporting service (`acme-legacy`).
You don't want to shut down your main environment just to check something quick.

```bash
hun run acme-legacy
```

Now `acme-legacy` is running alongside `acme-core`.
**hun** notices that both use port 8080. It automatically shifts `acme-legacy` to 8081.
You check the bug, fix it, and kill the legacy app.

```bash
hun stop acme-legacy
```

You are back to just `acme-core`. Zero Friction.

## 02:00 PM - Deep Debugging

Something is wrong with the payment webhook. You need to see the logs *and* the worker output at the same time.
You open the TUI again.

```bash
hun
```

You see the `payment-worker` service is red. You select it and press `Enter` to see the crash log.
Ah, a missing env var. You fix it in `.hun.yml` or your `.env` file.
You press `r` to restart just that service. It goes green.

## 05:00 PM - Clean up

You are done for the day. You don't want stray node processes eating your battery overnight.

```bash
hun stop --all
```

Silence.

**hun** isn't about adding *more* to your workflow. It's about removing the friction between you and your work.
