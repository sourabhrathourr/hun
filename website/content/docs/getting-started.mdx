Let's take `hun` for a spin.
We will initialize a project, switch to it, and see how it feels to have your development environment managed for you.

<Steps>

<Step>
### Initialize a Project

Go to one of your existing projects. It could be a simple Node.js app, a Go service, or a Docker Compose stack.

```bash
cd ~/my-cool-project
hun init
```

**hun** will scan your directory. It looks for `package.json`, `go.mod`, `docker-compose.yml`, and other common indicators. It will then generate a `.hun.yml` configuration file for you.

</Step>

<Step>
### Switch and Enter TUI

This is the magic moment. Run `hun` to enter the TUI (Terminal User Interface).
If the project isn't running, **hun** will automatically start it for you.

```bash
hun
```

You are now in the **Command Center**.
-   **Services are starting**: Watch them go from `STARTING` to `RUNNING` in real-time.
-   **Logs are live**: Select any service to see its output immediately.

**This is your new home.** You don't need to juggle multiple tabs anymore.

</Step>

<Step>
### View Logs

Navigate with `↑` / `↓` keys.
Press `Enter` on a service to expand its logs.

Press `Esc` to go back to the list.

</Step>

<Step>
### Restart a Service

Did you change a config file? Need to bounce the API?
Just hover over the service and press `r`.

</Step>

<Step>
### Quit TUI (Keep Running)

When you are done looking at logs, just press `q`.
**Your project keeps running in the background.**

You can close your terminal, open a new one, and run `hun` again. Everything will be exactly where you left it.

</Step>

<Step>
### Stop Everything

When you are actually done for the day:

```bash
hun stop
```

</Step>
