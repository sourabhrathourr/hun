The Terminal User Interface (TUI) is the **primary** way to interact with **hun**.
It connects directly to the daemon's ring buffer, making it faster and more comprehensive than any CLI command.

Access it by running:

```bash
hun
```

## Why TUI First?

1.  **Instant Feedback**: See services go from `STARTING` to `RUNNING` (or `ERROR`) in real-time.
2.  **Unified Logs**: see multiple services interleaving their logs without mixing them up.
3.  **Zero Latency**: No overhead of starting a new process just to check status.

## Navigation

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `↑` / `↓` | Select a service |
| `Enter` | View logs for selected service |
| `Esc` | Back to service list |
| `q` | Quit TUI (services **keep running**) |

## Actions

| Key | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| `r` | Restart selected service |
| `R` | Restart **all** services in project |
| `s` | Stop selected service |
| `/` | Filter logs (search mode) |
| `c` | Copy mode (pause scrolling to select text) |
| `p` | Project Switcher (fuzzy find) |

## The Project Switcher (`p`)

Press `p` to open a fuzzy finder of all your registered projects.
-   Select one and press `Enter` to switch to it immediately.
-   If you are in Multitask mode, it will switch focus to that project in the UI.

## Viewing Logs

When viewing logs:
-   `f` toggles "Follow" mode (auto-scroll).
-   `w` toggles wrapping lines.
-   `Shift + ↑/↓` scrolls faster.
