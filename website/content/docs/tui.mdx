The Terminal User Interface (TUI) is the **primary** way to interact with **hun**.
It acts as a global dashboard for all your projects.

Access it from anywhere by running:

```bash
hun
```

If you are already running projects, you will see their status.
If not, use the **Project Switcher** (`p`) to start one.

## Why TUI First?

1.  **Instant Feedback**: See services go from `STARTING` to `RUNNING` (or `ERROR`) in real-time.
2.  **Unified Logs**: see multiple services interleaving their logs without mixing them up.
3.  **Zero Latency**: No overhead of starting a new process just to check status.

## The Project Switcher (`p`)

Press `p` to open a fuzzy finder of all your registered projects.
-   Select one and press `Enter` to switch to it immediately.
-   If you are in Multitask mode, it will switch focus to that project in the UI.

## Viewing Logs

When viewing logs:
-   manual scrolling pauses live mode and shows unread count.
-   `l` resumes/toggles live mode.
-   `Shift + ↑/↓` scrolls faster.
-   `v` starts selection at the current cursor and pauses live mode.
-   selection can be done with keyboard (`v` + arrows) or mouse (click / Shift+click).
-   when a selected service is stopped, logs pane shows a stopped-state view instead of stale log rows.

## Mouse Support

- Click a project tab to focus it.
- Click a service to select it.
- Click in logs to set cursor.
- Shift+click in logs to extend selection range.
- Mouse wheel scrolls logs, services, and the picker list.
