## Choose your OS

**hun** is a single binary with zero runtime dependencies. It installs in seconds.

### macOS & Linux

The easiest way is via Homebrew.

```bash
brew tap hundotsh/tap
brew install hun
```

Or if you prefer a direct script (auditable, of course):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://hun.sh/install.sh | sh
```

### From Source (Go)

If you have Go installed and want to build from source:

```bash
go install github.com/sourabhrathourr/hun@latest
```

## Verify Installation

Once installed, verify that `hun` is in your PATH.

```bash
hun --version
```

If that prints a version number, you are good to go.

### Note on Shell Integration

**hun** does *not* require any shell plugins, aliases, or weird `.rc` file modifications. It just works as a standard CLI tool.

However, many users like to alias `h` to `hun` because they use it so much.

```bash
# Optional: Add to basic shell config
alias h=hun
```
